# Security Portfolio & CTF Write-ups

This repository is a curated collection of practical write-ups and code from hands-on penetration testing and ethical hacking exercises. More than a log of tasks, it documents a methodologyâ€”a critical approach to vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and the ethics of disclosure. Each project deconstructs a system not just to exploit its flaws, but to understand the architecture of its failures and the implications of its design.

## Overview

`ethical-hacking-ctf-writeups` is a living portfolio that demonstrates applied skills in network reconnaissance, web application enumeration, steganography, and vulnerability exploitation. It serves as a tangible record of my practice in ethical hacking methodologies, moving beyond theoretical knowledge to engage with the material realities of digital security.

## Certifications

The work within, particularly the **"Double Trouble"** exercise, functioned as the practical assessment for the **30-Day Ethical Hacking & Bug Hunting Bootcamp** (Nikistian Media Private Limited, May 2025). These documents represent the translation of certified knowledge into actionable skill.

### ðŸš© Double Trouble: A Capture The Flag Analysis

A comprehensive penetration test against a target machine, dissecting its defenses through structured reconnaissance, enumeration, and exploitation. This exercise was not merely about finding a flag but about mapping a vulnerability lifecycleâ€”from initial discovery to proof-of-concept execution.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**

*   **Network Reconnaissance:** Employing `netdiscover` and `nmap` for host discovery, port scanning, and service fingerprinting. This is the cartography of a target digital landscape.
*   **Web Application Enumeration:** Methodically discovering hidden directories and critical files using `dirb`, revealing the underlying structure often omitted from surface-level interaction.
*   **Steganography & Password Cracking:** Extracting hidden data and credentials from image files using `StegSeek` and targeted wordlist attacks, challenging the assumption that visibility equates to security.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** Identifying and analyzing public exploits (e.g., qdPM 9.1 RCE) and leveraging resources like Exploit-DB. This situates a specific flaw within the broader context of known security failures.
*   **Exploitation:** Synthesizing gathered intelligence to gain access, demonstrating the practical consequence of theoretical vulnerabilities.
